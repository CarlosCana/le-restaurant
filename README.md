# Le Restaurant

Here is the link to go visit the app https://le-restaurant.herokuapp.com/

Things that are important in this app

* Ruby 2.5.1

* Build in Rails

* No need for Database creation (Really?)

* No need for Database initialization (Why would you do it?)

* No need to run the test suite (Because there is none)


### Deployment instructions

``sq
git clone <"link">
bundle install
rails s
``

And then throw a nice localhost:3000 in your brwoser and you're ready to go.

and by the way, I (CCana) made this and I copied the text from this nice restaurant that you should visit if you live in Paris: https://www.ajidulce.fr/ (thank me later).

You're welcome!
